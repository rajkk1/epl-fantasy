    "After signing up to https://fantasy.premierleague.com/ and going to \"squad\" selection, we see that we have to choose a total of 15 players (2 goalkeepers, 5 defenders, 5 midfielders and 3 forwards) to make up our team. We will simplify this problem to trying to choose the best team of 11 (i.e. without subs) players with the highest total score without exceeding our budget of 100 pounds (and just pick the cheapest players as subs for each position)."

    "Firstly we start off by saving a bunch of html files. Under \"Player selection\", we can select what players to view. What we want to do is save the data by position for each position. So firstly, we choose \"Goalkeepers\" and we then save the webpage as \"GK1.html\". Then, at the bottom of the \"Player selection\" table, we can click on the arrow to go to the next page and then save it again as \"GK2.html\". Next we move on to choosing \"Defenders\" only and repeat the process (so we should have \"D1.html\" to \"D6.html\"). And we repeat the process for the midfielders (giving us \"MF1.html\" to \"MF8.html\") and forwards (giving us \"F1.html\" to \"F3.html\"). Make sure that these files are saved in the same location as this notebook. **Note:** It's important that we leave the \"Sorted by\" field as *Total Score* and \"With a maximum price of\" as *Unlimited*. This is because we want all the players in order of their total score to run the code. And it is also important that you make sure your squad is empty. Otherwise the program will add some extra rows to the data (it messes up the scraping). I used google chrome but I think it should work with other browsers too.\n",
