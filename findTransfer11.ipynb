In this simple method, we will only transfer a single player, since it costs points to transfer more than 1 and we will no look into the cost-benefit analysis of that. We are also just going to make the transfer that will give the biggest increase in total score."

    "Firstly we start off by saving a bunch of html files. We save the current team by clicking \"My Team\" and saving the page as \"curTeam.html. Then under \"Transfers\", we can select what players to view. What we want to do is save the data by position for each position. So firstly, we choose \"Goalkeepers\" and we then save the webpage as \"GK1.html\". Then, at the bottom of the \"Player selection\" table, we can click on the arrow to go to the next page and then save it again as \"GK2.html\". Next we move on to choosing \"Defenders\" only and repeat the process (so we should have \"D1.html\" to \"D6.html\"). And we repeat the process for the midfielders (giving us \"MF1.html\" to \"MF8.html\") and forwards (giving us \"F1.html\" to \"F3.html\"). Make sure that these files are saved in the same location as this notebook. **Note:** It's important that we leave the \"Sorted by\" field as *Total Score* and \"With a maximum price of\" as *Unlimited*. This is because we want all the players in order of their total score to run the code. And it is also important that you make sure your squad is empty. Otherwise the program will add some extra rows to the data (it messes up the scraping). I used google chrome but I think it should work with other browsers too.\n",
